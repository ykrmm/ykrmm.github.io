At the beginning of 2023 I was teaching assistant for the master in data science TRIED of CNAM. I gave practical classes on deep learning topics with the Keras framework. 
The website of the course with all the practical works and presentations are available at this [link](http://cedric.cnam.fr/~thomen/cours/US330X/index.html).
